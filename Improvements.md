* Can time zones be taken into account when creating pairs? Large time differences make finding a time suitable for both sides difficult.
* Add additional pairing groups. e.g.: 
  * "F# on the web"
  * "Type providers"
  * Compiler topics" 
  * "Machine Learning and Data Science" 
* Can preferred (human) language be taken into account when creating pairs? Using a language both sides are comfortable with would help, and it would also probably help with the time zone issue.
