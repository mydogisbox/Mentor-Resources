######## 1) Language Basics

* Hello World!
Introduce mentees through the hello world from F# example. This, in theory, helps ensure that they have a functioning REPL environment and know how to execute code. You should adapt this section to fit the environment that the mentee and the mentor are working in.

For example:
  - Show student Visual F# through Visual Studio, probably suggest F# Power Tools, show them how to send code to interactive.
  - Show student Visual Studio Code, probably suggest the Ionide project, show them how to send code to interactive.
  - Show student Emacs fsharp package or Spacemacs fsharp layer, show them how to send code to interactive.

**NOTE: At least mention that ;; is needed in interactive if this applies to your environment. This confuses people regularly.

* let bindings for notion of assignment
Abstract the hello world example using a let bound string. Keep it simple and avoid connecting the dots to functions for now.

* simple algebra 
Show simple algebriac operators and bind them to variables. Consider using this time to explain the difference between primitive types if the mentee is new to programming.

* functions
Bring out the big guns and open their eyes to the glory of functions. Start simple by abstracting the algebra you did above and slowly get more complex. Topics to consider: currying, tupled versus non-tupled arguments, recursive functions.
